# Contributing to ViMMS
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Software bugs or adding new features

We welcome any bug reports on ViMMS, and if you have any questions regarding the framework, please feel free to ask us.

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
If you'd like to propose new features, please open a new Issue as well so we can discuss it first.
